    question: "Is Endospheres Therapy painful?",
    answer:
      "Endospheres Therapy is generally comfortable and is often described as a firm, rhythmic massage. Some areas may feel more intense or sensitive, but the pressure can be adjusted to your comfort level. Temporary redness or mild soreness may occur afterward.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there downtime?",
    answer:
      "No significant downtime is typically required. Most people can return to their normal daily activities immediately after treatment. Temporary redness or mild soreness can occur but usually resolves quickly.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Endospheres help cellulite?",
    answer:
      "Endospheres is designed to improve the appearance of cellulite through compressive microvibration and mechanical stimulation of the tissues. Research on vibration therapy has also found improvements in cellulite grade after a course of treatments, although results can vary between individuals.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Endospheres support lymphatic drainage?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The treatment uses rhythmic mechanical compression to stimulate tissue movement and support fluid circulation. Endospheres materials specifically describe reduced lymphatic fluid retention as one of the intended effects of body treatments.",
  },
  {
    question: "When will I notice results?",
    answer:
      "Some people notice changes after the first few sessions, particularly in skin texture and fluid retention. For more noticeable and lasting body-contouring and cellulite improvements, a course of treatments is generally recommended. One published Endospheres study evaluated results over multiple sessions, while other clinical information recommends a personalized treatment course.",
